Project Title: Foodber

Two mobile applications, one for customers and one for business owners. 

Customers can use the app to locate nearby food trucks either on the map or nearby trucks page. Once they choose a food truck they can view their menu and start placing orders online. When checking out they will be led to a page that has stripe applied to it.

Motivation: 

The lack of modern day application providing real time data of actual food truck locations and actual operating hours.

How to Install:

    Copy repo into a folder
    Npm install
    Npm start
    Using the Expo app, scan QR code to run the app
    

Tech/framework:

Built with: React Native, React Native Maps, Firebase, Expo, Redux

Features:

Customer application: customers can see a list of nearby trucks or see them on google appear on google maps. Customers can also place orders online and checkout using stripe.
